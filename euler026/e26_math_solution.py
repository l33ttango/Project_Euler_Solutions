Euler 26
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

1/2	= 	0.5
1/3	= 	0.(3)
1/4	= 	0.25
1/5	= 	0.2
1/6	= 	0.1(6)
1/7	= 	0.(142857)
1/8	= 	0.125
1/9	= 	0.(1)
1/10	= 	0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

SOLVED

See https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Maximum_Period_of_Reciprocal_of_Prime

From Period of Reciprocal of Prime, the period of recurrence is the order of 10
 modulo p.
That is, it is the smallest integer d
 such that:
10**d â‰¡ 1(mod p)
